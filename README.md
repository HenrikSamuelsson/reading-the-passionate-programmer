## Part 1 - Choosing Your Market

First part of the book is what to think about when investing time in efforts intended to help your career and general well-being as a software developer. Can be thought of as investing money, will need to make an analyze before choosing what to invest in.  

### Tip 1: Lead or Bleed?

There is limited time available and many technologies to master. Need to try to make an informed decision on what the invest time and money on.

Can be beneficial to invest time in learning new technologies that might be a hit and come into high demand. On the other hand it can pay-off to have expertise in old dying technologies because these will need to be maintained and there is limited amount of people that can do this in the end.

Besides the new and old there is also a big part in the middle that have been around for a while an likely to stick around, these technologies are relevant to learn more about.

#### Exercise 1: Act on It Lead or Bleed

List of early, middle, and late adaption technologies, as I see it in 2023.

##### Early

Rust, Kotlin, Matlab, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Low-code development, IoT, Cloud Computing, Progressive Web Apps, Microservices, DevSecOps, robotics and drones.

##### Middle

Python, C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Internet, Databases, Base operating systems (Windows, Linux, Android), Software development in general, PC's, System Design, containers, Git, code quality.

##### Late

Java, Assembly, Fortran, Cobol, Ruby, wired communication, Eclipse, Subversion, Non-ip networks.

### Tip 2: Supply and Demand

What is in demand will vary over time. New technologies can be lucrative at the start but if there is a shortage an high compensation levels the market will eventually catch up and fill the gap. However in general there is always demand for deep expertise in any given area.

Outsourcing can be a challenge if living in a country with high living standards and hence high salaries. There is a risk that the company moves part or the whole development department to country with lower costs. It can be beneficial to keep track on what technology low cost countries specialise in and then either avoid this tech or ensure having expertise knowledge in this area to fend of the competition.

#### Exercise 2: Act on It Supply and Demand

Off shore countries offer a wide array of different services such as blockchain, application programming interfaces, application development, data analytics, AI, testing services, support services.

Since such a wide array of services are offered the best option is probably to specialise and work hard to become expert in a given field or ideally in a few fields.

### Tip 3: Coding Don't Cut It Any More

Do not neglect the business domain. A business domain defines the company's overall area of activity. Generally speaking, it's the service the company provides to its clients.

#### Exercise 3: Act on It Coding Don't Cut It Any More

Do read the news on your companies website and the company news letters. Follow blogs and news channels related to your business domain.

Have lunch with or coffee with the business side of the company you work at.

### Tip 4: Be the Worst

The essence of this tip is that you need to you need to surround yourself with people that are better than you and then make sure your learn from them.

#### Exercise 4: Act on Be the Worst

Can try to work with people that are better than you at work. Can also work at side project on your spare time, can be open source project that are a little bit easier to get into than closed projects that you need a contacts in your network to gain access to.

### Tip 5: Invest in Your Intelligence

Learn other programming languages than the one you use the most. Motivation here is that it shows to recruiters that you are seriously into software development.

Would like to add here that learning other types of languages tends to teach you about he weaknesses in your daily language and think of ways of working around these.

#### Exercise 5: Act on Invest in Your Intelligence

I personally at work do systems programming in C, C++. Could possibly go for more script like languages like Python, or make something for he Web to act on this tip.

### Tip 6: Don't Listen to Your Parents

Don't trade fun for safety. Can be safe to work 9 to 5 at a big solid company but it if it is'nt fun then your are wasting away your only short life.

#### Exercise 6: Act on Don't Listen to Your Parents

Exercise to think about how much fear drives career choices. In my case not so much, when starting a new job it has usually been due to not functional work environment or because you should change job every third year because it has been proven beneficial for your salary growth.

### Tip 7: Be a Generalist

Do not only do the absolute minimum and or spend time on gold plating your part of the code. Instead if having a little time over learn about the other technical parts that make up the product your company develops.

Knowing more things will increase your value. It will also make your life easier since you can solve more problems when having the bigger picture, and sometime you can find the problem and solve it without having to wait for support from other departments.

#### Exercise 7: Act on Be an Generalist

I would like to build an emulator of my companies system in [Renode](https://renode.io/).

### Tip 8: Be a Specialist

Specialist here equals expert in some programming language. This means more than knowing language well and some common libraries. For a compiled language this would mean knowing details about the compilation process, for a language that runs on a virtual machine it would mean knowing details about how the virtual machine works. Being a specialist will increase your value because you will be able to solve obscure problems and also help out more junior team members with basic problems.

#### Exercise 7: Act on Be a Specialist

Find and study the advanced material for the language that you specialise in.

Teach others about the language, teaching others is a great way to gain deeper understanding yourself.

### Tip 9: Don't Put All Your Eggs in Someone Else's Basket

This tip relates to be a specialist, the specialisation should not be to narrow. Especially it is not ideal to be specialised in a technology that is is proprietary and only delivered from one single company. The company might for example be bought by an competitor that only want to buy the company to liquidate the technology to get it off the market. It is high risk to be very much specialised in something that you have limited control over.

#### Exercise 9: Act on Don't Put All Your Eggs in Someone Else's Basket

Look into various way to acheive what you specialise in with products from different vendors. For example if you use ordinary use one set of tools delivered by one company, try building a duplicate of parts of your project with tools from another company.

For me personally as an embedded developer this could mean trying two different real time operating systems and ensuring that the rest of the code base is independent of the operating system used.

### Tip 10: Love It or Leave It

It is generally hard to become great at something if you are not passionate about and instead do it only for money, this is true also for software engineering.

#### Exercise 10: Act on Love it or Leave It

If not passionate about your job, find another job or check up on possibilities to do something else on your current job.

Think about and take notes on what you enjoy doing and who you enjoy working with. Then think about how you can get to do more of what you like and less of what you do not like. Can the not so fun part be delegated, or automated away, maybe even just ignored.

## Part 2 - Investing in Your Product

Part 2 seems to pretty much the same topics as part 1, unclear to me why the book is separated into two books, maybe so you can divided the reading of the book over two days :-)

### Tip 11: Learn to Fish

It is important to be self sufficient to have full control of your career. Don't ask people to do something for you, ask them to show how to do it and if possible do it yourself next time.

This also goes for digital assistants and wizards, these can be used but ideally you should now how to do it yourself from scratch to avoid being vendor dependent (see also tip 9).

#### Exercise 11: Act on Learn to Fish

Have noticed in the drawing program that I use to document architecture in UML that there are some more complex figures with dynamic behaviour. These however do not alway behave as I want them to behave. Will learn how to make my own variants and put these in a library that will enable me to work faster in the future.

### Tip 12: Learn How Businesses Really Work

Learn about the business.

Related to Tip 3: Coding Don't Cut It Any More but more about how the company is doing in financial terms.

Would personally argue that this is not a priority since it does not really matter how a particular company is doing because there is an abundance of other companies that you can work for if you are good at what you do.

#### Exercise 12: Act on Learn How Businesses Really Work

Recommendation was to buy a MBA book, browsed around among these but in the end I landed on a somewhat related book Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes are High, Third Edition that seemed interesting so will read this.

The term bottom line obviously comes from the result when adding up everything, expenses and income, as an engineer you know enough about math to understand this. Business people tend to have somewhat shallow knowledge in mathematics so might not be obvious to them tough.

### Tip 13: Find a Mentor

Ties in with the tip on surrounding yourself with people that are better than you are. A mentor can help you become better faster by pointing you in the right direction.

#### Exercise 13: Act on Find a Mentor

There are guides available on-line if not being able to find a mentor. The reason for me starting this book is actually because I am on a guide to learn C++, see [CppDeveloperRoadmap](https://github.com/salmer/CppDeveloperRoadmap).

### Tip 14: Be a Mentor

Being a mentor will force you to reorganize your knowledge in your mind deepening the knowledge.

Being a mentor will increase the size of your network and make it stronger.

#### Exercise 14: Act on Being a Mentor

If nothing else you can always start by answering question at a forum such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

### Tip 14: Practice, Practice, Practice

Must do deliberate practice to get better. The practise should be a bit of a pain to stretch you limits.

Some ideas on practice:

- Learn a new programming language
- Learn new ways to implement a known problem
- Do katas, meaning solving an old problem again, time yourself trying to do it faster and faster
- Try to make a program faster, benchmark it for speed
- Try to make a program use less memory, benchmark it for memory consumption
- Read other persons code and improve upon it, motivate your improvements
- Enter coding competitions

#### Exercise 14: Act on Practice, Practice, Practice

Solve a problem for example from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) or the [Coding Dojo](https://codingdojo.org/).

## Tip 15: The Way That You Do It

Developing software is a process and some ways of developing software have been proven better than others. Fortunately many different methodologies have been have already been developed that have been proven to work well. Our work as developers will become easier in the long run if taking the effort to learn and follow one of these methodologies.

#### Exercise 15: Act on The Way That You Do It

DevOps can be considered a software metrology, will read the books[Accelerate DevOps with GitHub](https://www.packtpub.com/product/accelerate-devops-with-github/9781801813358) and [Automating DevOps with GitLab CI/CD Pipelines](https://www.packtpub.com/product/automating-devops-with-gitlab-cicd-pipelines/9781803233000).

Shall while reading get hands on and apply some of the concepts, to improve upon my knowledge in this area. Hope to learn about the differences between GitHub and GitLab to be able to choose what platform to go for as default for new projects.

## Tip 16: On the Shoulder of Giants

There has already been written a lot of great software. Learning can be accelerated by studying this software. The proper way to learn is to study code like reading a book, really take your time and dive deep into small sections of code.

#### Exercise 16: Act on On the Shoulder of Giants

Will study a project at work that another developer have made.

## Tip 17: Automate Yourself into a Job

A lot of things that software developers do can be automated. Benefits are speed increase and less mistakes once the automation scripts have been developed, drawback is the initial investment in time.

Your value as a developer will increase if having an proven track record of automating things.

#### Exercise 17: Act on Automate Yourself into a Job

When doing exercise from books I tend to use a certain structure to organize the solutions in the file system. I create this structure manually as I do the exercises. This could be automated by having a script create the folder structure and some template files for me.

## Part 3 Executing

This section holds tips on going from theory to practice to enable being a finisher that takes projects all the way.

## Tip 18: Right Now

When in a project always keep the focus on what the team can do right now to move on step closer to finishing.

There is a saying called Parkinsons Law:

> “Work expands so as to fill the time available for it scompletion

If you have time you tend to fill up the time, if yo do not have time your are forced to prioritize.

By keeping focus on what can be done right now we can move faster and fight Parkinsons law.

#### Exercise 18: Act on Right Now

Have a task to get rid of static code checking warnings in a project, this can be fixed by right now just check out the warnings for a given file and fix this single file.
