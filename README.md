## Part 1 - Choosing Your Market

First part of the book is what to think about when investing time in efforts intended to help your career and general well-being as a software developer. Can be thought of as investing money, will need to make an analyze before choosing what to invest in.  

### Tip 1: Lead or Bleed?

There is limited time available and many technologies to master. Need to try to make an informed decision on what the invest time and money on.

Can be beneficial to invest time in learning new technologies that might be a hit and come into high demand. On the other hand it can pay-off to have expertise in old dying technologies because these will need to be maintained and there is limited amount of people that can do this in the end.

Besides the new and old there is also a big part in the middle that have been around for a while an likely to stick around, these technologies are relevant to learn more about.

#### Exercise 1: Act on It Lead or Bleed

List of early, middle, and late adaption technologies, as I see it in 2023.

##### Early

Rust, Kotlin, Matlab, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Low-code development, IoT, Cloud Computing, Progressive Web Apps, Microservices, DevSecOps, robotics and drones.

##### Middle

Python, C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Internet, Databases, Base operating systems (Windows, Linux, Android), Software development in general, PC's, System Design, containers, Git, code quality.

##### Late

Java, Assembly, Fortran, Cobol, Ruby, wired communication, Eclipse, Subversion, Non-ip networks.

### Tip 2: Supply and Demand

What is in demand will vary over time. New technologies can be lucrative at the start but if there is a shortage an high compensation levels the market will eventually catch up and fill the gap. However in general there is always demand for deep expertise in any given area.

Outsourcing can be a challenge if living in a country with high living standards and hence high salaries. There is a risk that the company moves part or the whole development department to country with lower costs. It can be beneficial to keep track on what technology low cost countries specialise in and then either avoid this tech or ensure having expertise knowledge in this area to fend of the competition.

#### Exercise 2: Act on It Supply and Demand

Off shore countries offer a wide array of different services such as blockchain, application programming interfaces, application development, data analytics, AI, testing services, support services.

Since such a wide array of services are offered the best option is probably to specialise and work hard to become expert in a given field or ideally in a few fields.

### Tip 3: Coding Don't Cut It Any More

Do not neglect the business domain. A business domain defines the company's overall area of activity. Generally speaking, it's the service the company provides to its clients.

#### Exercise 3: Act on It Coding Don't Cut It Any More

Do read the news on your companies website and the company news letters. Follow blogs and news channels related to your business domain.

Have lunch with or coffee with the business side of the company you work at.

### Tip 4: Be the Worst

The essence of this tip is that you need to you need to surround yourself with people that are better than you and then make sure your learn from them.

#### Exercise 4: Act on Be the Worst

Can try to work with people that are better than you at work. Can also work at side project on your spare time, can be open source project that are a little bit easier to get into than closed projects that you need a contacts in your network to gain access to.

### Tip 5: Invest in Your Intelligence

Learn other programming languages than the one you use the most. Motivation here is that it shows to recruiters that you are seriously into software development.

Would like to add here that learning other types of languages tends to teach you about he weaknesses in your daily language and think of ways of working around these.

#### Exercise 5: Act on Invest in Your Intelligence

I personally at work do systems programming in C, C++. Could possibly go for more script like languages like Python, or make something for he Web to act on this tip.

### Tip 6: Don't Listen to Your Parents

Don't trade fun for safety. Can be safe to work 9 to 5 at a big solid company but it if it is'nt fun then your are wasting away your only short life.

#### Exercise 6: Act on Don't Listen to Your Parents

Exercise to think about how much fear drives career choices. In my case not so much, when starting a new job it has usually been due to not functional work environment or because you should change job every third year because it has been proven beneficial for your salary growth.

### Tip 7: Be a Generalist

Do not only do the absolute minimum and or spend time on gold plating your part of the code. Instead if having a little time over learn about the other technical parts that make up the product your company develops.

Knowing more things will increase your value. It will also make your life easier since you can solve more problems when having the bigger picture, and sometime you can find the problem and solve it without having to wait for support from other departments.

#### Exercise 7: Act on Be an Generalist

I would like to build an emulator of my companies system in [Renode](https://renode.io/).

### Tip 8: Be a Specialist

Specialist here equals expert in some programming language. This means more than knowing language well and some common libraries. For a compiled language this would mean knowing details about the compilation process, for a language that runs on a virtual machine it would mean knowing details about how the virtual machine works. Being a specialist will increase your value because you will be able to solve obscure problems and also help out more junior team members with basic problems.

#### Exercise 7: Act on Be a Specialist

Find and study the advanced material for the language that you specialise in.

Teach others about the language, teaching others is a great way to gain deeper understanding yourself.

### Tip 9: Don't Put All Your Eggs in Someone Else's Basket

This tip relates to be a specialist, the specialisation should not be to narrow. Especially it is not ideal to be specialised in a technology that is is proprietary and only delivered from one single company. The company might for example be bought by an competitor that only want to buy the company to liquidate the technology to get it off the market. It is high risk to be very much specialised in something that you have limited control over.

#### Exercise 9: Act on Don't Put All Your Eggs in Someone Else's Basket

Look into various way to acheive what you specialise in with products from different vendors. For example if you use ordinary use one set of tools delivered by one company, try building a duplicate of parts of your project with tools from another company.

For me personally as an embedded developer this could mean trying two different real time operating systems and ensuring that the rest of the code base is independent of the operating system used.

### Tip 10: Love It or Leave It

It is generally hard to become great at something if you are not passionate about and instead do it only for money, this is true also for software engineering.

#### Exercise 10: Act on Love it or Leave It

If not passionate about your job, find another job or check up on possibilities to do something else on your current job.

Think about and take notes on what you enjoy doing and who you enjoy working with. Then think about how you can get to do more of what you like and less of what you do not like. Can the not so fun part be delegated, or automated away, maybe even just ignored.

## Part 2 - Investing in Your Product

Part 2 seems to pretty much the same topics as part 1, unclear to me why the book is separated into two books, maybe so you can divided the reading of the book over two days :-)

### Tip 11: Learn to Fish

It is important to be self sufficient to have full control of your career. Don't ask people to do something for you, ask them to show how to do it and if possible do it yourself next time.

This also goes for digital assistants and wizards, these can be used but ideally you should now how to do it yourself from scratch to avoid being vendor dependent (see also tip 9).

#### Exercise 11: Act on Learn to Fish

Have noticed in the drawing program that I use to document architecture in UML that there are some more complex figures with dynamic behaviour. These however do not alway behave as I want them to behave. Will learn how to make my own variants and put these in a library that will enable me to work faster in the future.

### Tip 12: Learn How Businesses Really Work

Learn about the business.

Related to Tip 3: Coding Don't Cut It Any More but more about how the company is doing in financial terms.

Would personally argue that this is not a priority since it does not really matter how a particular company is doing because there is an abundance of other companies that you can work for if you are good at what you do.

#### Exercise 12: Act on Learn How Businesses Really Work

Recommendation was to buy a MBA book, browsed around among these but in the end I landed on a somewhat related book Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes are High, Third Edition that seemed interesting so will read this.

The term bottom line obviously comes from the result when adding up everything, expenses and income, as an engineer you know enough about math to understand this. Business people tend to have somewhat shallow knowledge in mathematics so might not be obvious to them tough.

### Tip 13: Find a Mentor

Ties in with the tip on surrounding yourself with people that are better than you are. A mentor can help you become better faster by pointing you in the right direction.

#### Exercise 13: Act on Find a Mentor

There are guides available on-line if not being able to find a mentor. The reason for me starting this book is actually because I am on a guide to learn C++, see [CppDeveloperRoadmap](https://github.com/salmer/CppDeveloperRoadmap).

### Tip 14: Be a Mentor

Being a mentor will force you to reorganize your knowledge in your mind deepening the knowledge.

Being a mentor will increase the size of your network and make it stronger.

#### Exercise 14: Act on Being a Mentor

If nothing else you can always start by answering question at a forum such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

### Tip 15: Practice, Practice, Practice

Must do deliberate practice to get better. The practise should be a bit of a pain to stretch you limits.

Some ideas on practice:

- Learn a new programming language
- Learn new ways to implement a known problem
- Do katas, meaning solving an old problem again, time yourself trying to do it faster and faster
- Try to make a program faster, benchmark it for speed
- Try to make a program use less memory, benchmark it for memory consumption
- Read other persons code and improve upon it, motivate your improvements
- Enter coding competitions

#### Exercise 15: Act on Practice, Practice, Practice

Solve a problem for example from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) or the [Coding Dojo](https://codingdojo.org/).

### Tip 16: The Way That You Do It

Developing software is a process and some ways of developing software have been proven better than others. Fortunately many different methodologies have been have already been developed that have been proven to work well. Our work as developers will become easier in the long run if taking the effort to learn and follow one of these methodologies.

#### Exercise 16: Act on The Way That You Do It

DevOps can be considered a software metrology, will read the books[Accelerate DevOps with GitHub](https://www.packtpub.com/product/accelerate-devops-with-github/9781801813358) and [Automating DevOps with GitLab CI/CD Pipelines](https://www.packtpub.com/product/automating-devops-with-gitlab-cicd-pipelines/9781803233000).

Shall while reading get hands on and apply some of the concepts, to improve upon my knowledge in this area. Hope to learn about the differences between GitHub and GitLab to be able to choose what platform to go for as default for new projects.

### Tip 17: On the Shoulder of Giants

There has already been written a lot of great software. Learning can be accelerated by studying this software. The proper way to learn is to study code like reading a book, really take your time and dive deep into small sections of code.

#### Exercise 17: Act on On the Shoulder of Giants

Will study a project at work that another developer have made.

### Tip 18: Automate Yourself into a Job

A lot of things that software developers do can be automated. Benefits are speed increase and less mistakes once the automation scripts have been developed, drawback is the initial investment in time.

Your value as a developer will increase if having an proven track record of automating things.

#### Exercise 18: Act on Automate Yourself into a Job

When doing exercise from books I tend to use a certain structure to organize the solutions in the file system. I create this structure manually as I do the exercises. This could be automated by having a script create the folder structure and some template files for me.

## Part 3 Executing

This section holds tips on going from theory to practice to enable being a finisher that takes projects all the way.

### Tip 19: Right Now

When in a project always keep the focus on what the team can do right now to move on step closer to finishing.

There is a saying called Parkinsons Law:

> “Work expands so as to fill the time available for it scompletion

If you have time you tend to fill up the time, if yo do not have time your are forced to prioritize.

By keeping focus on what can be done right now we can move faster and fight Parkinsons law.

#### Exercise 18: Act on Right Now

Have a task to get rid of static code checking warnings in a project, this can be fixed by right now just check out the warnings for a given file and fix this single file.

### Tip 20: Mind Reader

Practice listening and planning ahead for what needs to be done in a project. Then get on it and do the tasks. Your boss and your team will be surprised and happy to see that something that is already done will be done.

Beware that things that the customer have strong opinions on such as the user-interface should not be changed without involving the customer.

#### Exercise 20: Act on Mind Reader

Practice mind reading by before a meeting in a project just before the meeting start try to predict what the decision on what to be done in the project next.

Prepare material for example documentation that you think other team members might find useful, then when you get a question on the project answer their question by showing them the documentation. Wikis and readme files are a good format for this type of documentation.

### Tip 21: Daily Hit

Ensure that you do something daily that is in line with the companies goals.

Your company probably have written goals, and you as an employee will likely have some type of development plan. Each and every day write down something small that can be done to take you closer to the goal.

Inform your manager when having some progress on of the goals by completing daily hits.

If not having time for daily hits try having weekly hits.

#### Exercise 21: Act on Daily Hit

Will on sundays make a list of 5 daily hits to do for the coming week based on work related goals.

### Tip 22: Remember Who You Work For

Align yourself with the needs of the business and also align the business with your needs. This will ensure that you’re executing on the right things.

Aligning goes both vertical and horizontal in the meaning that one must align with the team members as well as the managers.

#### Exercise 22: Act on Remember Who You Work For

At the point on writing this its vacation times but when getting back there will be a start-up meeting. This meeting will be a good opportunity to get aligned with the business needs.

### Tip 23: Be Where You're At

The long term goal can be to move up the career ladder but it should not take away the focus from the short-term goals. Most of the focus should be on the present. It is hence best to set short-term goals, perhaps weekly, that align with the long term goals. Then during the week focus on reaching the short-term goals. During the weekend its then time to recalibrate the long term goals with next weeks short-time goals.

#### Exercise 23: Act on Be Where Your're At

At the start of the week make a plan for what to acheive during the coming week at your current job. Include a little something that will help you move a bit closer to your next dream job.

During the week focus on your current job and follow the plan. During lunches and breaks with your co-workers, focus the conversation on the goals of the weekly plan.

Bit by bit this will take you to next step in your career.

### Tip 24: How Good a Job Can I Do Today

Not all tasks to do at work are created equal. Some task will be more uninteresting and annoying. A strategy for handling these task is to turn them into a competition.

Say that you have neglected updating the documentation then try to focus on getting the documentation up to perfection with 100 coverage of all components. This will seem like a lot of hard work but this is the point we want it to be seen as a challenge, mighty quest that will take a hero to conquer.

Making something harder will actually make you more motivated than just doing quick and dirty fix to follow a rule imposed by the system.

#### Exercise 24: Act on How Good a Job Can I Do Today

Pick a task that your have postponed. Plan for when and whom to present the result then get going with the aim of doing the task with perfection to meet your deadline, making the result visible of your hard work will motivate you.

### Tip 25: How Much Are You Worth

Need to keep in the back of the head how much value you bring to the company compared to how much you cost.

What you cost is the easiest part this about twice what you get as a salary.

The value that you bring to the company is much harder. But what we can think about it at least how we can bring more value. Can we make the development more efficient, how? Can we add a feature that the customers will like? Can we use software to take away some hardware component to cut the cost of the next generation product?

The goal here is that you should provide twice the value to the company compared to what you cost. Then it is a no-brainer for the company that they will want you to stay at the company.

#### Exercise 25: Act on How Much Are You Worth

Find out a little something about what the financial goals are for your company for the next year.

### Tip 26: A Pebble in a Bucket of Water

There is a thinking among some developers that you can become irreplaceable by sitting on knowledge that only you have. Thinking this way is a liability for the company since it creates a risk for the company. If you decide to leave it will cause trouble for the company. The conclusion is that trying to make yourself irreplaceable will instead actually increase the risk that you will be replaced.

#### Exercise 26: Act on A Pebble in a Bucket of Water

Always strive for writing code and documentation that makes it easy for someone else to take over your job. Ensure that you share knowledge that only you have to anyone that will take the time to listen to you.

### Tip 27: Learn to Love Maintenance

It is more common wanting to start over with new projects than maintaining old code. The idea being that is easier to get new code correct and clean than getting the old code base up to standard. There is also a thinking that there is more status in developing something new than maintaining old code.

The above thinking is flawed due to that as soon the first piece of code for a new project have been checked in you have already entered the maintenance phase again. It is also so that maintenance of old code will sooner or later include adding new features. There is in reality no clear line between maintaining and developing code for green field projects.

#### Exercise 27: Act on Learn to Love Maintenance

Create metrics for measuring the improvement of the code that you are responsible for maintaining. Measure before and after refactoring the code and note the progress you make. The metrics will motivate you work on the code. The metrics can also be presented to your manager making it possible to have a measure that proves how you provide value to the company.

Example of metrics:

- Number of warnings reported by static code checkers
- Cyclomatic complexity measured by static code checkers
- Up-time of the system
- Number of error log entries
- Test coverage
- Reduced number of bugs in the project backlog
- Added features from the backlog
- More complete documentation
- Automation of tasks that previously was done manually

### Tip 28: Eight Hour Burn

Working only eight hours a day can bee seen as a wast of time since this is only about half the available hours each day, assuming using eight hours for sleep. How ever only working eight hours is also good because having less hours will create a sense of urgency to make the most of the limited time at work.

Only working eight hours will also more or less completely eliminate the risk of burn out because there will be plenty of time to relax. Need to remember that we are in it for the long run, its a marathon not a sprint.

Keep in mind that working a lot can make you seem dedicated but it can also make it look that your are having trouble handling your work.

#### Exercise 28: Act on Eight-Hour Burn

Ensure having good sleep hygiene and sleep well. Then when waking up do your morning routine including breakfast then get on working hard:

- Work hard for four hours starting the same time every day
  - Tick does tasks off
  - No wasting time
  - Work according to the plan
- One hour lunch after four hours
  - Talk to colleagues during lunch to stay aligned on the goals
  - Ideally include some physical activity during lunch, walk, or a quick intense workout
- Work hard another four hours after lunch
  - Hardest part since can be a bit tired after the food, might wanna include a power nap
  - Keep an eye on the time left of the day to motivate you to work intensely
  - Always stop working after fours hours, no cheating staying extra at work
- Leave work and enjoy the rest of the day todo whatever you want

### Tip 29: Learn How to Fail

Program defensively with asserts and unit test so that failures becomes visible as early as possible. Failures will happen, detecting a failure is good and important to find early before the customer detects it.

When a problem is found raise the issue as early as possible. Take responsibility for the problem. Aim to have a suggested solution to the problem already when communicating the problem. Do ask for help if struggling with how to resolve the problem.

### Tip 30: Say No

The natural inclination might be to say yes to everything. Ensure that you always take a moment to think before saying no or yes to do a requested task. Missing the deadline will make you look back and eats away on your value and credibility.

#### Exercise 30: Act on Say No

Stay organized on your commitments by having a list with every commitment each task shall have the following headers:

- Who asked you to do the task (Requester)
- What date should it be finished, make up your own date if not given (Due Date)
- What did you commit to (Commitment)
- Optional notes section, if overridden document this here for future reference (Notes)
- Record when you delivered (Completed Date)

Review this list daily, communicate failures as early as possible.

### Tip 31: Don't Panic

Panic mode is maybe some type of overload on our brain. Back in the day panic might have served a purpose kicking of a fight or flight response to a dangerous situation. At the office you however seldom have to choose if to fight a bear or flee from it. Panic will not really serve any purpose for software developers. It is better to instead always keep cool and take time to analyze the input before making a decision on what to say or do.

#### Exercise 31: Act on Don't Panic

Since there is no need to panic because it does not help it is important to recognise when the monkey part start making the fast decisions and then have a micro-pause to let the more evolved but slower parts of the brain come into play.

Take notes on any time that your get into or close to panic mode. How does it feel. Try to becoming better at recognizing panic and understand that there is no idea to panic. Need to float above trying to see the bigger picture and base our actions on this instead.

### Tip 32 Say It, Do It, Show It

The essence of this tip is that an three step process should be followed.

1. Say it is the same as plan what to do, plan can be more or less detailed but there should be a planning step with written down results on what to do and also when to do it.
2. Do it, this is execute on the plan, you have the plan and now it is up to you to ensure that you don't do anything else until the daily step in the plan have been accomplished. This will make you meet the deadline.
3. Show it means communicating to management and team mates what have been done. This is important since you will come across as a doer and will get more freedom and influence in the future.

## Part 4 Marketing... Not Just for Suits

It is no idea to be great at software development if no-one knows it. Part of your work is to market yourself. Part four of the book is tip about how to market your services and knowledge.
