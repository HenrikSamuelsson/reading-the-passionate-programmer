## Tip 1: Lead or Bleed?

There is limited time available and many technologies to master. Need to try to make an informed decision on what the invest time and money on.

Can be beneficial to invest time in learning new technologies that might be a hit and come into high demand. On the other hand it can pay-off to have expertise in old dying technologies because these will need to be maintained and there is limited amount of people that can do this in the end.

Besides the new and old there is also a big part in the middle that have been around for a while an likely to stick around, these technologies are relevant to learn more about.

### Exercise 1: Act on It

List of early, middle, and late adaption technologies, as I see it in 2023.

#### Early

Rust, Kotlin, Matlab, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Low-code development, IoT, Cloud Computing, Progressive Web Apps, Microservices, DevSecOps, robotics and drones.

#### Middle

Python, C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Internet, Databases, Base operating systems (Windows, Linux, Android), Software development in general, PC's, System Design, containers, Git, code quality.

#### Late

Java, Assembly, Fortran, Cobol, Ruby, wired communication, Eclipse, Subversion, Non-ip networks.

## Tip 2: Supply and Demand

What is in demand will vary over time. New technologies can be lucrative at the start but if there is a shortage an high compensation levels the market will eventually catch up and fill the gap. However in general there is always demand for deep expertise in any given area.

Outsourcing can be a challenge if living in a country with high living standards and hence high salaries. There is a risk that the company moves part or the whole development department to country with lower costs. It can be beneficial to keep track on what technology low cost countries specialise in and then either avoid this tech or ensure having expertise knowledge in this area to fend of the competition.

### Exercise 2: Act on It

Off shore countries offer a wide array of different services such as blockchain, application programming interfaces, application development, data analytics, AI, testing services, support services.

Since such a wide array of services are offered the best option is probably to specialise and work hard to become expert in a given field or ideally in a few fields.

## Tip 3: Coding Don't Cut It Any More

Do not neglect the business domain. A business domain defines the company's overall area of activity. Generally speaking, it's the service the company provides to its clients.

### Exercise 3: Act on It

Do read the news on your companies website and the company news letters. Follow blogs and news channels related to your business domain.

Have lunch with or coffee with the business side of the company you work at.

## Tip 4: Be the Worst

The essence of this tip is that you need to you need to surround yourself with people that are better than you and then make sure your learn from them.

### Exercise 4: Act on Be the Worst

Can try to work with people that are better than you at work. Can also work at side project on your spare time, can be open source project that are a little bit easier to get into than closed projects that you need a contacts in your network to gain access to.

## Tip 5: Invest in Your Intelligence

Learn other programming languages than the one you use the most. Motivation here is that it shows to recruiters that you are seriously into software development.

Would like to add here that learning other types of languages tends to teach you about he weaknesses in your daily language and think of ways of working around these.

### Exercise 5: Act on Invest in Your Intelligence

I personally at work do systems programming in C, C++. Could possibly go for more script like languages like Python, or make something for he Web to act on this tip.

## Tip 6: Don't Listen to Your Parents

Don't trade fun for safety. Can be safe to work 9 to 5 at a big solid company but it if it is'nt fun then your are wasting away your only short life.

### Exercise 6: Don't Listen to Your Parents

Exercise to think about how much fear drives career choices. In my case not so much, when starting a new job it has usually been due to not functional work environment or because you should change job every third year because it has been proven beneficial for your salary growth.
